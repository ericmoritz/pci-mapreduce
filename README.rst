Programming Collective Intelligence and Riak Map Reduce
========================================================

These are my application of O'Reilly Media's book
`Programming Collective Intelligence`_ with Riak's map reduce.

These is just a demonstration of how apply map/reduce to ML algorithms
to map/reduce to distribute computation across a cluster.  These most
likely won't be the most optimized for real world data.
